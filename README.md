# Scratch org tooling for Sandbox

## Status: **WIP**
Got as far as setting up the different features and configs in the scratch org config JSON file. Turns out as of Spring 25, a plain-old developer edition does not itself have the features enabled in order to run both Data Cloud and Agentforce (no permset licenses). 

## Features

### Scratch org definition file
Found at `config/agentforce-scratch-def.json`

### Stored flags settings
Found in `config/flags`

Decided to give this a try as an alternative to make running wordy commands faster/easier. Interesting features.
